# Another Pong Clone

## A WIP javaFX/OpenFX pong clone
This project was started by me not long after completing my undergraduate course in Software Development. As many may know, such courses have a tendency to emphasise the theoretical side of software development, at the expense of thorough practical application. So, the main purpose of me starting this project is that of a practical exercise where I can begin to apply my knowledge in some way. And that was why Pong was chosen because Pong is fairly simple as games go and I have judged it to be a good initial project. 

This project uses JavaFX/OpenFX which at the time of writing I not all too well familiar with. Yet, I found this project to be a good opportunity to introduce myself to and form an understanding of this Graphical/UI package. 

### Development
+ Openjdk 14
+ javaFX (OpenJFX) 14

### Special Mention
Implementing a game loop JavaFX is not the most intuitive process and so I used Stemkoski, L (2015) implementation of a game loop with javaFX using a Timeline Animation.
